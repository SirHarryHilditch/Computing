Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. In 1989, while working at CERN, <br> he created a way to link and access information over the internetâ€”leading to the first website, <br> web browser, and web server.

He later founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to set standards <br> and keep the web open and fair. A strong advocate for digital rights and data privacy, he continues to push for <br> a better, more user-controlled web.

He was knighted in 2004 and is widely seen as one of the most influential tech pioneers in history.
